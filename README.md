# ☕ Java Programming Journey: Core to Advanced

Welcome to your comprehensive Java learning repository! This project takes you from fundamental concepts to advanced programming techniques, with practical examples and hands-on code.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is designed as a progressive learning path for Java developers at any level. Whether you're just starting out or looking to master advanced concepts, you'll find well-structured, documented code examples that build upon each other.

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Core Concepts
Master the fundamentals of Java programming with practical examples:

- **Conditional Logic**: Learn decision-making structures
- **User Input Handling**: Work with Scanner and data input
- **Control Flow**: Understand if-else statements and logical operators
- **Mathematical Operations**: Apply arithmetic and modulo operations

### Current Projects

#### 1. Number Comparison Tool
**File**: `CheckGreatestOfThreeNumbers.java`

Compare three numbers and identify the greatest value. This project demonstrates conditional logic and comparison operators.

**Key Concepts**: Nested conditionals, logical operators, user input

#### 2. Armstrong Number Validator
**File**: `CheckingArmstrong.java`

Check if a number equals the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits. Includes helper methods for digit-counting and custom exponentiation.

**Key Concepts**: Digit manipulation, custom power function, mathematical validation

#### 3. Prime Number Tester
**File**: `CheckingPrimeNo.java`

Determine whether a given integer is prime. Uses an optimized trial-division loop that exits early on factors.

**Key Concepts**: Trial division, early-exit loops, boundary cases (1, 2, 3)

#### 4. Leap Year Calculator
**File**: `CheckLeapYear.java`

Decide if a year is a leap year via the full Gregorian-calendar rules (divisible by 4, 100, and 400).

**Key Concepts**: Modulo arithmetic, compound boolean conditions, calendar mathematics

#### 5. Even/Odd Checker
**File**: `CheckOldAndEven.java`

Classify an integer as even or odd with the modulo operator.

**Key Concepts**: Modulo arithmetic, single conditional, user interaction

#### 6. Bit-Level Even/Odd Checker
**File**: `CheckOldEvenByBitWise.java`

Same task as above, but uses bitwise AND (`& 1`) for instantaneous parity detection.

**Key Concepts**: Bitwise operations, low-level optimization

#### 7. Sign Detector
**File**: `CheckPositiveAndNegative.java`

Report whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

**Key Concepts**: Relational operators, three-way branching

#### 8. Factorial Computer
**File**: `FactorialOfNumber.java`

Compute n! iteratively for any non-negative integer supplied by the user.

**Key Concepts**: Iterative accumulation, factorial definition, input validation

#### 9. GCD Finder
**File**: `FindGCDofNumbers.java`

Calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers with a decrement-and-test algorithm.

**Key Concepts**: Common divisor logic, pairwise comparison, iterative search

#### 10. LCM Finder
**File**: `FindingLCMOfNumbers.java`

Determine the least common multiple by scanning upward from the larger number until a shared multiple appears.

**Key Concepts**: Multiple scanning, multiplication properties, edge-case handling (≤ 0)

#### 11. Fibonacci Series Generator
**File**: `PrintingFibonacci.java`

Output the Fibonacci sequence up to the largest value not exceeding the user-supplied limit.

**Key Concepts**: Sequence generation, string concatenation, loop control

#### 12. Star-Pattern Printer
**File**: `PrintingStarPatterns.java`

Draw two styles of text-based star triangles—incremental-width and decremental-width—based on user input.

**Key Concepts**: Nested loops, string building, console graphics

#### 13. Multiplication Table Printer
**File**: `PrintMultiplicationTable.java`

Display the 1-to-10 multiplication table for any given number.

**Key Concepts**: Loop-driven tables, formatted console output

#### 14. Digit Reverser
**File**: `ReverseDigitsOfNumbers.java`

Reverse the decimal digits of an integer using place-value multiplication.

**Key Concepts**: Place-value decomposition, custom power-of-ten helper, long-return safety

#### 15. Sum of Odd Numbers
**File**: `SumAllOldTillNumber.java`

Add every odd integer from 1 up to and including the user’s input.

**Key Concepts**: Arithmetic progression, step-2 iteration, accumulator pattern

#### 16. Digit-Sum Calculator
**File**: `SumOfDigits.java`

Sum all individual digits of an integer.

**Key Concepts**: Digit extraction, modulo/divide loop, additive accumulation
