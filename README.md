# ☕ Java Programming Journey: Core to Advanced

Welcome to your comprehensive Java learning repository! This project takes you from fundamental concepts to advanced programming techniques, with practical examples and hands-on code.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is designed as a progressive learning path for Java developers at any level. Whether you're just starting out or looking to master advanced concepts, you'll find well-structured, documented code examples that build upon each other.

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Core Concepts
Master the fundamentals of Java programming with practical examples:

- **Conditional Logic**: Learn decision-making structures
- **User Input Handling**: Work with Scanner and data input
- **Control Flow**: Understand if-else statements and logical operators
- **Mathematical Operations**: Apply arithmetic and modulo operations

### Current Projects

#### 1. Number Comparison Tool
**File**: `CheckGreatestOfThreeNumbers.java`

Compare three numbers and identify the greatest value. This project demonstrates conditional logic and comparison operators.

**Key Concepts**: Nested conditionals, logical operators, user input

#### 2. Leap Year Calculator
**File**: `CheckLeapYear.java`

Determine whether a given year is a leap year using proper calendar rules. Implements the complete leap year algorithm.

**Key Concepts**: Modulo operations, complex conditional logic, calendar mathematics

#### 3. Even/Odd Checker
**File**: `CheckOldAndEven.java`

Identify whether a number is even or odd using the modulo operator.

**Key Concepts**: Modulo arithmetic, basic conditionals, user interaction

#### 4. Number Sign Detector
**File**: `CheckPositiveAndNegative.java`

Classify numbers as positive, negative, or zero with proper handling of edge cases.

**Key Concepts**: Comparison operators, if-else-if chains, zero handling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A text editor or IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code recommended)
